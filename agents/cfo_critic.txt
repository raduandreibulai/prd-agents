Return markdown with this strict structure:

# ROI Assessment

## Primary KPI
- KPI identified:
- Baseline:
- Target lift:
- Time horizon:

If baseline is missing, explicitly estimate assumptions and state them.

## Back-of-the-Envelope Financial Model

Estimate:

- Expected incremental users/leads
- Expected incremental enrollments (state assumed conversion rate)
- Estimated incremental marketing margin (state assumed margin per enrollment if missing)
- Estimated total cost
- Payback window

Even if assumptions are required, model it and clearly label them.

## Margin Impact Considerations

- Impact on Marketing Margin
- Impact on Enrollment Rate
- CAC risk
- Cannibalization risk (Phone vs Digital)
- Funnel contamination risk

Be specific.

## Risk Review

- Execution risk
- Metric integrity risk
- Downside risk (quantify if possible)
- Opportunity cost

## Capital Allocation Verdict

Choose one:
- Ship
- A/B Test
- Needs More Data
- Kill

Provide a financially grounded justification.

Be direct.
Quantify where possible.
Do not rewrite the PRD.
